# SimCLR
A PyTorch Google Colab implementation of SimCLR based on ICML 2020 paper [A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709).



## Requirements
- timm
- kaggle
- opencv-python-headless==4.1.2.30 
- wandb 


## Dataset
This code is implemented using Google Colab Free GPU and ["Apparel images dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/apparel-images-dataset) is used in this implementation. 



## Results
There are some difference between this implementation and official implementation, the model ('ResNet18','efficientnet_b0') is trained on 
one COLAB GPU:
